However, due to recent security and logistics regulations, direct delivery of cash in physical form to individual cities or residential addresses has been restricted.\n\nTo comply with federal transportation guidelines and avoid any legal complications, the safest and most reliable option at this point is to deposit the full amount into a designated bank account under your name.\n\nThis process ensures traceability, eliminates delivery risk, and allows for immediate access once the deposit is completed. Kindly provide a valid bank account for the transfer, and our team will proceed with the deposit without delay.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation.'}};
